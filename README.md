# Image File Converter w/ UI

The project will be a program that will allow the user to choose an image file from a less desirable format and export the image into a more desirable file format. Image formats that will be accepted are PNG, JPEG, WebP, Tiff, and BMP. There will be a user interface that will display the image the user chose and a drop-down box to allow the user to choose what format they want to convert the image into. The program will use the C++ programming language with the “Qt” framework to implement the user interface. The program will use the OpenCV library to properly import images to manipulate them in code.
